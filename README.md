### Copy a skeleton template
Every month we need to create the same folder structure based on year, month, and day of the meetup, so bin/copy_skeleton.sh comes to the rescue

From the top folder, run the following
```
  bin/copy_skeleton.sh 2024-02-06 2024-03-05
```

After that, all the new folder will be setup and you must change the content: venue, speakers, etc...
